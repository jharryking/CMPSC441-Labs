# Imaginative Use of Tool Calling
Tool calling could be used to transfer callers to certain departments. Usually whenever a person calls a general phone number for a business, they are asked to select a number based on what department they want to talk to. However, not everybody knows which department can answer their question. Even when they do know the general department they want to talk to, there might be subdivisions of that department that require them to be manually transferred.

Using an AI model that has tool calling would allow the callers to simply just ask the question they want answered and the AI model could determine which department best fits that question. Not only could this give the users a better experience, but it could also help the business. To implement this system you would need to create an AI model that converts speech to text and sends it to another AI model that determines the response to the question. The response model would need to have a tool that takes in a department parameter, which would have all of the departments listed and their associated descriptions. In addition, you could have a parameter that summarizes the reason for the call so the representative could see it before the caller is transferred. You could also have a parameter that determines the urgency of the call. This would allow for callers with extremely urgent matters to be transferred more quickly than those with less urgent matters.
